# Breaking Bad Data Code Submission

## About/Goal of this Project
Welcome to the Breaking Bad Data Code Submission for the RAISE-24 Datathon! This project focuses on sentiment analysis using a variety of techniques and datasets.

### Project Structure

- `./data`: Contains all necessary data files, including both provided datasets and generated CSV files after preprocessing.
- `./corpus`: Directory for installing NLTK built-in corpus.

### High-Level Description

#### Required Data Files in `./data` Directory
- `labeled_headlines_10k.csv`
- `Dataset_10k.csv`

#### File Functions

1. **Cleaning/Preprocessing Files**
    - `cleaning_csv.ipynb`: Notebook for cleaning and preprocessing CSV data.
    - `preprocessing.ipynb`: Notebook for general data preprocessing steps.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - `EDA_P1.ipynb`: First part of EDA focusing on initial data exploration and simple visualizations.
    - `EDA_Pt2.ipynb`: Second part of EDA with further exploration and visualizations.

3. **Sentiment Analysis Techniques**
    - `Vader.ipynb`: Notebook implementing sentiment analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) tool.
    - `ZeroShotEmotions.ipynb`: Utilizes zero-shot classification to analyze emotions in the dataset.
    - `zeroShotmodel.ipynb`: Implements a custom zero-shot classification model for sentiment analysis.
    - `lda.ipynb`: Notebook for Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling.

4. **Additional Analytics and Visualizations**
    - `emotion_distributions.ipynb`: Analyzes emotion distributions within the dataset.
    - `visualizations.ipynb`: Provides additional visualizations and analytics.
