## Goal of this Project

In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving, public perception is significantly influenced by how AI is portrayed by the media. This yearâ€™s RAISE 2024 data science competition delves into the intricate relationship between public opinion of AI and media narratives. The challenge is to determine whether news media plays any role in fostering a sense of fear or apprehension towards AI and to identify dominant themes, sentiments, and topics that AI news headlines convey. 

### Task
Participants will be provided with a dataset containing news headlines related to AI. Their task is to analyze these headlines to uncover the narratives surrounding AI in the media. The challenge involves using analytical text analytics and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful insights from these headlines. The goal is to generate innovative data-supported insights that deepen our understanding of media dynamics, promoting a more informed and empowered public discourse on AI.

### Objectives
- Analyze news headlines to identify prevalent themes, sentiments, and topics related to AI.
- Determine if news media contributes to a sense of fear or apprehension towards AI.
- Use NLP techniques to extract meaningful insights and patterns from the headlines.
- Provide data-supported recommendations for promoting a more informed public discourse on AI.
